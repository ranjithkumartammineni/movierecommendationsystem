**Movie Recommendation System**
**Project Overview**
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. It leverages various recommendation algorithms to suggest movies that align with the user's tastes. The system is built using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, allowing for personalized movie suggestions.

**Features**
Personalized Movie Recommendations: Suggests movies based on user ratings, preferences, and movie metadata.
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes user data to provide recommendations by comparing similarities between users.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarities in movie attributes such as genre, cast, or director.
User Interaction: Users can rate movies, which helps the system improve recommendations over time.
Scalable Design: The system can handle a large dataset of movies and users, making it suitable for real-world applications.
**Technologies Used**
Python: Core programming language for building the recommendation algorithms.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for implementing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
**Usage**  
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the web application using python app.py.
Access the movie recommendation system through the local web interface.
**Future Improvements**
Implementing a hybrid recommendation model combining collaborative and content-based filtering.
Adding a user authentication system to track individual user preferences.
Enhancing the recommendation algorithms with deep learning techniques.
Expanding the dataset to include more movies and genres.
